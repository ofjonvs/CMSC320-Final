    "The NFL is a multi-billion dollar business. There are millions of fans around the world, possibily even yourself, that invest a significant amount of time and resources to follow and watch their favorite teams and players. The teams are always working to fufill their duty to the fans. With the money they receive, they work on providing fans with the best experience possible, whether that's through giving them a great experience at the game with stadium rennovations or through building a winning team that makes fans want to tune in more. Every year, teams get around 225 million dollars to spend on players, with the money being paid through contracts. It's pretty straightforward, teams spend money on players that they think will benefit the team, and all is good, right? Obviously the answer is no, and there is a lot of nuance and subtleties that go into how much to pay players. Time and time again teams either give way too much money to certain players which ends up hurting the team, and many times teams avoid signing a certain player who ends up being a bargain for another. Then there is the question of how do we weigh which positions are worth more money. Each position has vastly different roles on a team, and therefore some are paid better than others. This however, also depends on the scheme the team has as that can affect how much they value each position. Then there are many more factors such as age and past performance that have to be accounted for. Then after all of that, even if done perfectly to the book can still end up not working. A player could not be a hard worker or lazy or had a fluke year, all of which are very hard to account for. So which are the factors you can account for? This is the question we will answer today, by looking through both basic box score predictions as well as ProFootballFocus' grading system, which breaks down the tape for every play of every player. This brings an element of context to the stats, which also can be deceiving based on what happens in a play, for example a quarterback can throw a perfect pass that gets dropped which would be considered an incompletion. We will do analysis on all different types of stats, advanced and basic, to determine which ones correlate with salary the best or how much each one correlates. This will give us a better picture of how we can predict what teams should pay a player based on their past performance and how much value in general they should add to a team. We will break down each category individually, by passing, rushing, receiving, blocking, run defense, pass rush and coverage, which will give us a nice split of positions and will allow us to differentiate the value of certain skills."
